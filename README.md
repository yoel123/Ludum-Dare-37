first fail at ludum dare. i didnt have time to finish it,the scope was way too big.
i shod of learned from my last time. or better yet from my first time. its my 3rd ludum dare.

the game is inspired by destruction carnival 2,considered one of the best freeware games .

controls:keys and space bare, when you shot it has auto lock for direction.

unimplemented lose or win screens,or lose or win conditions...and alot of other stuff.
will be implemented in post mortom and i will port it to my java framework too.
might take some time.

also this is the first compo that i use my phaser based js framework. 
last time i used a dom based js framework jad alot of issues so i switched to phaser.

also for anyone interested i can teach for free(for now) how to use my phaser and java game frameworks.
at least somthing good will come from all of this.
